#### Code + Results for simulation study with high variance

This simulation is the same as the one described in section 4.1.1 of the manuscript and in the README of [`mainSimStudy`](https://github.com/sanoke/approachesTEH/tree/master/mainSimStudy), 
except the outcome variance is 
now 100 units, instead of 1 unit. 

**Note** This particular simulation was not included in the manuscript, but is in the Appendix.
