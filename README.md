This repository contains code that will reproduce the analyses in our manuscript. 
The directories are defined as follows.

- **`mainSimStudy`** Simulation files to reproduce results corresponding to scenarios A, B, C, and D.
- **`mainSimStudy-higherVar`** Simulation files to reproduce results corresponding to scenarios A, B, C, and D, but the outcome variance is 100 units^2, rather than 10 units^2.
- **`mainSimStudy-nonLinearY`** Simulation files to reproduce results for scenario D*.
