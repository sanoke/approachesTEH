#### Code + Results for simulation study with high variance

This simulation is the same as the one described in section 4.1.1 of the manuscript and in the README of [`mainSimStudy`](https://github.com/sanoke/approachesTEH/tree/master/mainSimStudy), 
except the relationship between the covariates and the outcome mean is now
a quadratic function (instead of a linear function).

**Note** This particular simulation was not included in the manuscript.

**Note** Because of space, not all result files are stored here. One example result file from each simulation scenario (4 scenarios) and each estimation method (3 methods) are in the directory `res` (12 files).
