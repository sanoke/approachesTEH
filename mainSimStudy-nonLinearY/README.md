#### Code + Results for simulation study with high variance

This simulation is the same as the one described in section 4.1.1 of the manuscript and in the README of [`mainSimStudy`](https://github.com/sanoke/approachesTEH/tree/master/mainSimStudy), 
except the relationship between the confounders and the outcome mean is now
a quadratic function (instead of a linear function), corresponding to scenario D*.

**Note** Only the nonlinear scenario is simulated here, the other scenarios are contained in [`mainSimStudy`](https://github.com/sanoke/approachesTEH/tree/master/mainSimStudy).

**Note** Construction of the figure involves use of result files from the [main simulation study](https://github.com/sanoke/approachesTEH/tree/master/mainSimStudy).
